= Depot system =

The depot system is responsible for keeping track of 
what food is it stock at what place, in which amount, and
when it should be consumed.

== Stock information ==
Each type of food should be stored by a simple textual name which
the user is able to remember. The system stores how many items (or
other amount information) are available in the depot. Furthermore it
keeps track of when it should be consumed. 
Moreover the system stores in which place (fridge, cupboard, etc) the 
food has been put. The user can set up such places by his own liking. 

== Accessing the information ==
It should be possible to access the stock information from user's 
end devices like smartphones or PCs. This data includes particularly
browsing the amounts of food currently deposited and getting food
that should be consumed in short time. 

== Providing information ==
The user can also put information into the system. For each food item he 
has to provide the name, the amount and for each of these amounts the sell-by
date. 

== Features of the depot ==
The system checks in regular time intervals if it is running short on 
some kind of food. This information is gathered to suggest lists of 
food to buy.
