## Data Model

![Data Model](diagrams/ER-diagram.png)

### Date Timezones

| Place           | Format    |
|:---------------:|:---------:|
| Client code     | Localtime |
| Client database | UTC       |
| Network         | UTC       |
| Server code     | UTC       |
| Server database | UTC       |

## Architecture

### Client

Here interesting use cases for clients interacting with the server are
described.

#### Registering a New Data Item

![Registering new data](diagrams/put-data.png)

#### Refreshing the Client Database

![Refreshing](diagrams/Refreshment.png)

#### New Users' Registration

New users are always added by giving a ticket from an existing user. The details
are outlined in the diagram.

![Registration](diagrams/new-user-registration.png)

##### Principal Names

In the CSR the user stores the principals of his device. The values are
formatted inside the Common Name attribute of the CSR. The pattern is
`username$user_id$devicename$device_id`. So for the default test user this
resolves to `Jack$1$Device$1`. The principals are checked in the sentry part of
the server before the certificate is signed.

##### Client Verification

Upon receiving a new device registration request, the sentry performs the
following checks in order:

* Check if the ticket value presented by the client is found in the database

* Check the device id associated with the ticket from the database with the
  device id from the CSR

* Check if the remaining principals of the device match the CSR

* Check if the ticket has expired

If all the checks succeed the sentry has the CSR signed by the CA and returns it
to the client.

##### QR Code Tickets

For mobile clients it is more convenient to pass the ticket as QR code. To
generate this QR code the content of the ticket has to be entered text into the
QR code. The order of the values is the same as in the diagram description, i.e.

```
Username
Device name
User ID
Device ID
CA Fingerprint
Ticket
```

So for the default test user this resolves to

```
Jack
Device
1
1
<some FPR>
0000
```

#### Device Removal

## REST API

List of all available endpoints, methods, their parameters and result types.
Only `v2` endpoints are listed as their usage is strongly encouraged.

Response type schemas are indicated in a pseudo JSON notation. The anonymous
object ontop of each description is the root object. Any further types used
in that root object are described in "Common Data Structures" or directly
behind the root object.

### Common Data Types

#### Versions

Each entity in the system has a version which is incremented each time the
entity is edited. This means all modifying operations have to pass the correct
version of the entity to edit. If the version does not match an error is
returned using status codes, see "Status Codes" for a list of status codes
to support.

#### Status Codes

Numbers reporting the result status of a request. The API refers to this
via the `StatusCode` type.

* `0`: Success

* `1`: General error

* `2`: Not found

* `3`: Invalid data version

* `4`: Foreign key constraint violation

* `5`: Database unreachable

* `6`: Access denied

* `7`: Invalid argument

* `8`: Certificate authority unreachable

#### Timestamps

The timestamp format used is `yyyy.MM.dd-HH:mm:ss.SSS-Z`. Refer to
[the Java API Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html)
for semantics. The timestamps are passed as strings.

#### Response

Most calls only return a basic response with a status code. They have the
following shape:

```
Response {
    status: StatusCode
}
```

### Sentry
