## Data Model

![Data Model](diagrams/data-model.png)

## Architecture

### Client

Here interesting use cases for clients interacting with the server are
described.

#### Registering a New Data Item

![Registering new data](diagrams/put-data.png)

#### Refreshing the Client Database

![Refreshing](diagrams/refresh-data.png)

#### New Users' Registration

New users are always added by giving a ticket from an existing user. The details
are outlined in the diagram.

![Registration](diagrams/device-registration.png)

##### Principal Names

In the CSR the user stores the principals of his device. The values are
formatted inside the Common Name attribute of the CSR. The pattern is
`username$user_id$devicename$device_id`. So for the default test user this
resolves to `Jack$1$Device$1`. The principals are checked in the sentry part of
the server before the certificate is signed.

##### Client Verification

Upon receiving a new device registration request, the sentry performs the
following checks in order:

* Check if the ticket value presented by the client is found in the database

* Check the device id associated with the ticket from the database with the
  device id from the CSR

* Check if the remaining principals of the device match the CSR

* Check if the ticket has expired

If all the checks succeed the sentry has the CSR signed by the CA and returns it
to the client.

##### QR Code Tickets

For mobile clients it is more convenient to pass the ticket as QR code. To
generate this QR code the content of the ticket has to be entered text into the
QR code. The order of the values is the same as in the diagram description, i.e.

```
Username
Device name
User ID
Device ID
CA Fingerprint
Ticket
hostname
ca port
registration port
server port
```

So for the default test user this resolves to

```
Jack
Device
1
1
<some FPR>
0000
stocks.example
10910
10911
10912
```

#### Device Removal

## REST API

List of all available endpoints, methods, their parameters and result types.
Only `v2` endpoints are listed as their usage is strongly encouraged.

Response type schemas are indicated in a pseudo JSON notation. The anonymous
object ontop of each description is the root object. Any further types used
in that root object are described in "Common Data Structures" or directly
behind the root object.

#### Status Codes

Numbers reporting the result status of a request. The API refers to this
via the `StatusCode` type.

* `0`: Success

* `1`: General error

* `2`: Not found

* `3`: Invalid data version

* `4`: Foreign key constraint violation

* `5`: Database unreachable

* `6`: Access denied

* `7`: Invalid argument

* `8`: Certificate authority unreachable

### Prometheus

Tomcat exposes Prometheus metrics on the path `/stocks/metrics`. It gives
information about request durations, circuit breaker events and command retries
due to serialisation conflicts.

### Sentry

Endpoints listed here are only reachable via the sentry port. No client
certificate has to be presented here.

#### Health

`GET /stocks/health`: Inform about server health

It performs one test for DB connectivity and one for CA availability.

Result: `application/json`

```
{
    status: StatusCode
    data: Health
}

Health {
    database: boolean
    ca: boolean
}
```

#### User registration

`POST /v2/auth/newuser`: Register new device

Form parameters:

* `device: int` The id of the device which wants to register

* `token: String` The token generated when creating the new device

* `csr: String` The PEM X.509 Certificate Signing Request generated by the device

Result: `application/json`

```
{
    status: StatusCode
    data: String // PEM X.509 certificate signed by the stocks CA
}
```
