# Client installation

## First startup

On first start up the client will first ask for some config values.
For a vanilla server there is no need for adjustments, just press enter
to apply the defaults. Then a new certificate is generated using the values 
provided either by an existing user or using the created principals for the 
first user (see deploy-server/README.md).
