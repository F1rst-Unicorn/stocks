# Client installation

## First startup

On first start up the client will first ask for some config values.
For a vanilla server there is no need for adjustments, just press enter
to apply the defaults. Then a new certificate is generated using the values
provided either by an existing user or using the created principals for the
first user (see manual/server/server-installation.md).
