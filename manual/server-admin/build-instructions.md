# Build instructions

This guide tells how to build the server. 

## Arch Linux

Download the files deploy-server/PKGBUILD and 
deploy-server/stocks-server.install into an empty directory. Run makepkg in the
directory to build the package. Then install the resulting package on the target
machine. Now consider the manual/admin/server-installation.md for the 
installation.
